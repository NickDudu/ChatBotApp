CxwjfPIsvmI,2024-08-03T13:00:12Z,Why Americans Have No Economic Future,"July 2024. The U.S. economy continues to show
no signs of stopping. Housing prices hit all time highs. The S&P 500 hits an all time
high, and the combined net worth of all Americans
crossed $150 trillion. But while the U.S. has been booming for decades,
one group has been left behind. Young people older Americans saw their share of wealth
increased by 12% since 1989, while those under 40
saw a decline of nearly 50%. And now,
for the first time in 200 years, 30 year
olds are poorer than their parents. The social contract
that is now no longer in place for the first time in the U.S. is history. A 30 year old is no longer doing as well as are his
or her parents, were What went wrong? This is America,
the broken generation. The United States. The land of opportunity. From the beginning,
America was different. Unlike the rest of the world, it didn't matter who you were
or where you came from. Everyone had a shot
at the American dream. However, the reality on the ground
today is bleak, and the dream
is more like a nightmare. In 1985, the average home was four
and a half times the median household income. Today,
this number has ballooned by 50% to seven times
in a matter of 40 years. Life has become two times
as expensive. One of the main drivers
for this affordability crisis is underdevelopment. It's called Nimby.
Not in my backyard. City planners say the attitude
is spreading and causing widespread social disruption across
many major U.S. cities. Land owners have fought against
new developments to preserve their quality of life
and to ensure their property values stay high. Specifically, housing starts
as a proportion of the US population have dropped by 30%
compared to before 2000. This means that as the population
continues to grow, the number of homes
per person is declining. Driving up real estate prices. This reduced housing development has compounded over the years and has created
a major shortage of housing. Take a look at San Francisco. In 2024, the city only approved 16 housing permits and seven of those
were for single family homes. This is a city of a million people, and the surrounding metro area
has 7 million people and all they approved
was 16 housing permits. At the same time,
the share of homes owned by older generations has grown
significantly compared to the past. The proportion of homes owned
by Americans over 55 has increased by 23%,
while home ownership among those under 55 fell 19%. Older generations have gobbled up
real estate like candy, and they have created a system
that benefits them meaningfully lower taxes on capital gains,
the ability to forgo taxes through a 1031 exchange,
and much, much more. These homeowners are staying
in their homes longer than ever. 54% of them own their homes
outright. The rest have locked
in historically low interest rates. And to make matters worse,
HELOCâ€™s allow its homeowners to tap into their home equity
without having to sell. The result? They have no incentive to sell. This, in addition
to low development, has kept the housing market
artificially tight. Empty nesters are living in
large homes that are mostly unused, while young people struggle
to get by. Concurrently, a new player
has entered the housing market. Private equity. When I was in business school, there was nothing sexier in this
entire world than private equity. It's exactly where you went. If you wanted
to one day own an island. And one of my
classmates just bought an island. Private equity
currently owns 240,000 single family
homes in the United States. Now, this is only 5% of the overall
single family home until market, which is small, but the ownership
is concentrated in the Sunbelt. And this doesn't include ownership
in apartments, which have a much, much higher corporate
and private equity ownership rate. Analysts have shown that select
Sunbelt markets have over 50% ownership
by private investment firms, by concentrating their ownership
in key markets. They're able to drive down property
management and service costs while having an outsized role
in dictating market rents. For example,
between 2020 and 2023, rents for a two bedroom
detached home rose by about 44%. In Tampa,
43% in Phoenix and 35% in Atlanta. Compare this
to the national average of 24%. The average home buyer can't
compete against private equity. These firms are able to buy
large swaths of home in one go and make unconditional offers
with cash. Furthermore,
unlike mom and pop landlords, corporate landlords
are highly sophisticated and will do everything
to generate additional yield, even breaking the law. Recently, the Attorney General
of Washington, D.C. filed a case against 14
corporate landlords for price fixing through the analytics
company RealPage. RealPage helped landlords
optimize rents across 4.5 million units
in the United States. And here's the shocker RealPage is owned by private
equity firm Thoma Bravo. By taking data from millions of units, RealPage
is able to optimize pricing. And as you can see, the value
of data to these corporations is in the billions. When researching these videos,

ownership of homes is very obvious. To own as many homes
as humanly possible. And to create forever
renters out of would be homebuyers. And it seems like they are well on
their way of achieving their goal. It's projected that private equity
will own 40% of U.S. single family home rentals by 2038
times their current ownership. This will likely increase
the rent paid by renters, making it more challenging for them
to save up and buy a home, while at the same time
reducing the housing stock available to be bought,
driving up prices further. Historically, housing
has been a big wealth store. But with limited supply
created by older generations and increasing competition
for private equity, wealth is declining
among younger generations. Since 1989, wealth held by
those under 40 has declined by nearly 50%, while wealth held
by boomers has increased. There are few common explanations
older generations give for this. The first is that young
people don't work hard enough or they're lazy. And this is somewhat true. In 1985,
the average workweek was 35 hours. Today it's around 34 hours,
making us 3% lazier. Now, you don't need a PhD to see
that this is not the issue. The second point raised
is that young people spend money unnecessarily And although young people
spend more money on experiences and technology, they actually spend
less on physical goods. Balancing out most increases
in spending. The primary contributor to higher
spending with young people is the increased
relative value of housing, health care, and education. In fact,
if you remove housing from the equation, younger generations
spend less on average. And contrary to popular
belief, Gen Z and millennials are saving more of their earnings
than older generations. Lastly, people will claim
that young people are unskilled and need more education. But this is absolutely unfair. Every subsequent generation has
become more educated than the last. And Gen Z will continue this trend
and become even more educated than millennials. This, though, is expected
because society has pushed down the narrative that college
is necessary to progress in life. This would be fine and dandy
if there was a value to education. But sadly, college is more expensive
and less beneficial than ever. In 1980, the cost of attending
a four year college program, when adjusted for inflation,
was $10,000. Today, it's nearly $29,000. That's a 3X increase. But why? One simple word bloat. From 1976 to 2018, U.S. college enrollment grew by 78%. But at the same time, full time
faculty grew by 92%. Okay, that doesn't seem too bad. But administration, administration
grew by 164%. And other non
administrative professionals 452%. That means that
the professional staff at universities has far outpaced
the growth of students. Colleges are spending more and more money on things
other than education. More admin staff, more consultants. More fancy buildings. More of anything but education. To make matters worse,
even if you get an education, it doesn't really solve anything. In 1980, households
with a four year college education earned $100,000 per year. Today, they earn $118,000 per year. This is a real increase of 18%,
which seems good on the surface. However, during the same period
of time, the cost of a four year education has increased
from $40,000 to $115,000, a real increase of 188%. So here's
the marketing pitch for college. You can increase your earnings
by 18% by spending 190%
more than previous. Unlike in the past, it is no longer
a path to economic prosperity. Instead, young people are forced
into a perpetual education and credential machine. What once required a bachelor's
degree and entry level experience now requires a master's degree
and 300 years of experience. The cherry on top. It will cost you everything. Given how expensive education
is, most students have to take out large student loans. Currently,
the total balance of student debt in the United States
is $1.7 trillion. This number has grown
two times faster than wages over the last 20 years. But this isn't limited to student
loans. With rising living costs
and stagnating wages. The only way to make ends meet
for young people is accumulating more and more debt. Since 2013, credit card
debt has increased 26%, auto debt 14%, and mortgage
debt 44%. This increase is happening
while young people are earning 13% less than they did in 2013. But this isn't the only that the
young people need to worry about. While personal consumer debt
has been rising and young people are more indebted
than ever. The United States of America has gone on a debt binge unlike
anything the world has ever seen. Fiscal responsibility
has become a forgotten concept in the United States. Since the removal of the gold
standard, politicians have discovered
that there is no consequence to printing
endless amounts of money. And over the last 60 years,
government debt has grown three times faster than GDP
and now sits at $35 trillion versus GDP of $27 trillion. The only time debt was this high
in US history was World War two. The bloodiest, most destructive
conflict in human history. This debt is obviously not free
and has associated interest costs. Currently, the US is spending
16% of their annual budget on interest, or $624 billion. That's enough money to pay off
all student debt in three years. Sadly, there's literally
no mechanism to stop the government from spending money.
It does not have. Elected officials are not applying
it to balanced budgets. It cannot be fired
for overspending. They aren't measured on returns,
on invested capital. All they need to do is spend
the money and campaign for votes. Now, $35 trillion
sounds like a lot of money. And it is. But what if I told you
that the real debt number is much, much higher? Let me break it down. National debt is $34.6 trillion. State level debt adds $1.9
trillion to the mix. Unfunded Opeb
liabilities are another $1 trillion unfunded pension
liabilities. $7 trillion. And the biggest,
baddest of them all. Socialism Security and Medicare
contribute to a whopping $80 trillion
of additional liabilities. Therefore, the total actual debt
held by the United States government stands at a staggering
$123,875,000,000,533 million. That is five times
greater than the US GDP. Or put
another way, $370,000 per American. But in reality, if you're over 50,
you probably won't have to worry about this debt. Most of this debt
won't impact you. The lives of older generations
will be fine. Instead,
this spending will benefit old people and levy attacks
on the future of young people. So if we exclude those over 50,
the tax amounts to over $600,000. A person. To make matters worse,
the high cost of living is leading young people
to have fewer children. Without a sharp increase
in immigration. This will likely reduce production
and worsen the debt burden. But why and how would
the government spend so much money knowing it's nearly impossible
to ever pay it back? Do they not care about young people
and their future? The short answer? They don't. The Founding Fathers of the United States are often revered
as godlike figures. They are thought
of as distinguished and experienced individuals
who sought out to create the framework
for the greatest nation the world has ever seen. Surely these men must have been
wise and old. Let's see. James Monroe 18. Aaron Burr 20. Alexander Hamilton 21. James Madison 25. Thomas Jefferson 33. John Adams 40. And George Washington,
a distinguished 44. If you include everyone
who signed the Declaration of Independence,
the average age was 44. Now, let's take a look at Congress
today. The average age. 58. What about the Senate? 64. What's the median age
in the United States? 38. How can people nearly twice
the age of the average American, truly understand
the challenges they face? They can't. How are elected officials near the end of their lives supposed
to behave fiscally responsible when their decisions
won't burden them? They won't. Mitch McConnell took office in 1985
and is currently 82 years old. He can barely communicate. Yet he decides your future. Joe Biden is 81 years old
and was elected to office in 1970. Before any millennials
were even born. Today,
he's proposing major spending bills that he will never see
to completion. John McCain. Elijah Cummings and Diane
Feinstein all died while in office. These were people who were voting
on the future of the United States, but would never see it. How is this okay? Young
people are seeing rising costs of living and stagnating wages
across the country. Wealth is continually growing,
with older generations, while young people get poorer
and poorer. Education
continues to increase in price while becoming less valuable
in the market. Consumer debt is rising rapidly,
burdening young people more than ever. The US continues to spend
money like it grows on trees, handing out benefits to the old
while taxing the young. And all of this happens while young people are split
between red and blue. Wake up. The solution isn't Democrat
or Republican. We've seen both parties
come in and out over the decades, and your lives
have continued to get worse. They took away your dream
of starting a family. You said nothing. They took away the chance
to own a home. And you said nothing. They spend on programs for the old
and tell you to work forever. And you said nothing. And now, as you are tied up
for a lifetime of servitude, will you let them drain you
of every last bit of your future? Or will you stand up
and say, enough is enough? Take your future
into your own hands. Subscribe to 2and20 for more

_TUVXfM1nqo,2024-06-01T13:00:29Z,Why Living In Australia Is Impossible,"2023, for only the third time in 40 years, Australia entered a per capita recession. The result? Australian wages declined to levels not seen since June 2011. Even with devastating bushfires, the Covid 19 pandemic and lockdown. When polled, there was one thing that affected Australians more than anything else the cost of living. Over the last few decades, Australia has experienced one of the greatest housing booms the world has ever seen. Since 1973, Australian house prices have increased by 36 times across the capital cities and Sydney is now the second most unaffordable place to live in the world. How and why did we end up here? This is the dark side of Australia. Australia is one of the most beautiful places in the entire world, surrounded by oceans filled with world class beaches, cities and parks. The country looks like a Paradise, but if you want to live here, it's easier said than done. To buy the median home in Melbourne. A family needs to earn at least $170,000 per year. In Sydney, that number balloons to $260,000 per year. Compare this to the median household income in both cities of $100,000, and it becomes clear that home ownership is far out of reach for most Australians. Now, some might argue that this is only a Sydney or Melbourne issue, but that's just not the case. Since 2020, House prices in Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth have increased by over 50%, while wages only grew 12%. Home ownership is becoming less and less attainable for many Australians, especially young Australians. Oh it's rough, rough yea we can't find anything really. Young people have not had the luxury to benefit from skyrocketing home values and are constantly playing catch up. The result? Home ownership rates for people under 34 have declined nearly 25%. The craziest example of Australia's housing crisis was this home in Sydney. It was sold without a toilet, without power and without a kitchen. But that didn't stop a bidding war and someone paying $3.5 million. But what if you just want to rent? Surely you can find a decent place to rent. Sadly, no. Median rents in Sydney exceed $3,000 per month, while Brisbane is not too far behind at $2,500. Historically, Australian rental rates increased at a reasonable amount per year. However, since 2020, annual rental rates have skyrocketed by over 8% per year. People are caught between a rock and a hard place trying to pay 2024 rental prices with 2011 wages, and this would all be fine and dandy if people could find a place to live. But the demand for rental units is insatiable. Every rental unit application is met with dozens, if not hundreds of competing applications. Viewings have lines wrapped around blocks, and at the end of the day. Renters aren't fighting for anything beyond a place to live, a place to sleep, and a place to call home. 100 other people applied for my apartment and like did the interviews. It was really difficult. We were on Facebook groups for a while. There's just so much competition The dream of working hard to afford a comfortable life is slowly fading. And hard working, honest Australians are left feeling hopeless. All of this begs the question why is real estate out of control? The first culprit that many point to is immigration. Well this week the government say the migration system is broken and needs a massive overhaul from 2022 to 23 Australia welcomed nearly 740,000 people to put things into perspective. That's more immigrants than any year in modern Australian history and 200,000 more than pre-COVID levels. The impact of this huge spike in immigration is simple. More demand with the same housing supply equals higher prices. Specifically, economists and analysts believe that immigration has primarily impacted rental housing. The bulk of immigrants to Australia are temporary visa holders, and 70% of them are renters. The impact hits hard in migrant heavy suburbs, for example, Melbourne's south east or Sydney's inner southwest, saw 18% jumps in rents in the last year. In addition, immigrants are often willing to split their unit with more people to stretch their dollar. Out-competing locals. This has led to an increased yield on rental rates on real estate that had not been seen in Australia for decades. But what about housing? The argument that immigrants are a primary contributor to the increase in housing prices is quite weak. Australia's migration rate has actually decreased over the last decade and is in line with historical averages. However, over the preceding years and decades, there is one big difference. While immigration has continued to grow with the population, housing starts have declined. The construction industry is facing a catch 22, with the cost of building a new home rising again in 2023, 170,000 dwellings were completed, the lowest amount in a decade. At the same time, Australia saw the biggest spikes in immigration in a generation. So what gives? Since 1966, the number of homes being built relative to the population of Australia has been declining. Specifically, in the year 2000, building rates fell off a cliff, creating a significant supply shortage whose impact can still be felt today. One of the main culprits for Australia's decline in housing starts Is culture. Australia is a very suburban environment where communities and citizens have opted for urban sprawl over densification. For example, Sydney and Melbourne have about 2000 people per square kilometer. Compare this to 6000 in London, 4400 in Munich and 3600 in Amsterdam. It is a shocking difference when compared to other major Western cities. Australian cities are some of the least densely populated in the world. Many Australians believe that a suburban environment is ideal for raising families and safe communities. Thankfully, Australia has a ton of land that is mostly unpopulated. Theoretically, they can continue to build outward and maintain sprawl. Sydney alone could add 280,000 homes in its greenfield growth areas, but sadly this would work in theory. But Australia has a major NIMBY problem. Even though Australia is going through an extreme housing crisis, March 2024 saw the lowest number of detached home approvals since 2012. These aren't high rise condos. These are detached, single family suburban homes. Strong community advocacy and government red tape lead to extremely long approval times for housing developments. For example, to receive an approval for a single home development in New South Wales, it takes 111 days on average. In Liverpool, that jumps to 288 days. Compare this to Texas, where it generally takes less than a week. These long wait times have made it impossible for the government to achieve homebuilding targets specifically. Australia is on track to build 40% less homes than needed to meet the government's affordable housing targets. The low rate of approvals for housing has created an artificial land scarcity, which in turn has driven up the price of land. Since 2020, home values have risen at three times the rate of apartments. With land becoming such a scarce resource. It further challenges developments as it becomes increasingly expensive to acquire and develop land economically. But this is almost entirely by design. A scarce land benefits home owners. This has had a tremendous impact on young people in particular. Remember, home ownership rates for young people have dropped by 25% compared to only 8% for the general population. Okay, we can all agree that immigration and low development rates are worsening Australia's housing crisis. But there is another critical factor at play. Tax incentives. During the 1930s, Australia had a major housing shortage and wanted to encourage investment in rental properties. To encourage this, the country introduced negative gearing. Negative gearing allows an investor to offset the losses on a rental property against their personal income. For example, if you make $100,000 per year and lost $10,000 on your rental property, you can deduct the $10,000 off your personal income tax. This idea is pretty novel. In fact, out of the entire OECD, only New Zealand and Japan have these policies. During the 1980s, the government tried to change negative gearing rules, imposing restrictions on deductions that can be claimed. Similar to the United Kingdom. But this was met with significant backlash and negative gearing was returned to its original form. As the old adage goes, you can give, but you can never take. At the same time, in the 1980s, the government removed interest rate controls, which made it meaningfully cheaper for Australians to use debt to buy homes. This made negative gearing even more attractive and allowed people to leverage debt to execute the strategy. Now, this alone isn't enough to put Australia over the edge. Not only can you leverage negative gearing, but you can also hold real estate investments in your retirement account, known as a super. For those who don't know, a super is similar to an IRA like an IRA. A super has meaningful tax benefits and when buying real estate rental income taxes are reduced to 15% instead of your marginal rate. Unlike the US, where buying real estate through an IRA is a huge pain and costly, in Australia it's extremely easy and often encouraged. But that isn't all. There's more. In 1999, the Australian government reduced capital gains on real estate sales by 50%. And if you are holding your property in a super, you're effectively only paying a 10% tax. There is almost no country on earth that has such a favorable tax regime for property investors. Australia is truly exception. This tax regime has been criticized heavily. The argument against it is that it materially benefits land owners and older Australians. And frankly, the argument is quite sound. These tax policies have encouraged speculation in real estate and are costing taxpayers nearly $8 billion per year. Some might argue that this is overblown, but when 50 to 80% of all investment properties are negatively geared, there is a problem. A system that encourages speculation on income losing properties is highly flawed and very unique. But this has created another challenge. Australia has made it so good to invest in nonproductive assets like real estate, that no one bothers to invest in anything else. Australia's productivity growth has been slowing over the last few decades. The average annual labor productivity growth between 2010 and 2020 was only 1.1%, significantly lower than previous decades. A lot of this is due to the lack of innovation and growth in non-service and non-mining sectors in Australia. The best way to put in perspective how little Australia innovates is to look at its R&D spend as a percentage of GDP. In 2022, Australia spent 1.7% of GDP on R&D. When compared to other major nations, that is terrible. The OECD average is 2.4% and major countries like the US, Germany and the United Kingdom are all far better than Australia. As a result, nominal GDP per capita and real GDP per capita have not increased over the last ten years. Wages and job prospects are eroding while cost of living continues to rise. The loser? hard working Australians. Even when you compare business and income tax, it's clear that Australia is deciding that land ownership is the most important investment activity. Average income taxes charged in Australia are higher than all but three OECD countries, and corporate taxes are no different. Australia's corporate tax rate is 6.3% higher than the OECD average. And when comparing Australia's small business tax to even Canada's, Australia's is 2.5 times higher. Currently, Australia collects a disproportionate amount of government revenue from income taxes and corporate taxes, and a disproportionately low amount from real estate. As Charlie Munger famously said, show me the incentives and I'll show you the outcome. Here you have it a government that has incentivized speculation on housing while incentivizing working hard and building productive businesses. The incentive to hoard land, the outcome a terribly unfair economic system. I can already imagine the comments on this video blaming political parties for the issues at hand, and that might be easy to blame any single government for the housing crisis in Australia. But in reality, this problem has persisted for decades. The Labor Party of Paul Keating saw a modest rise in housing prices, while concurrently seeing a rapid modernization and growth of the overall Australian economy. Overall, his tenure was mostly balanced, but then John Howard came in and saw the greatest rise in housing prices in modern Australian history. Under his tenure, housing more than doubled. Then the Labor Party got three chances, but housing continued to grow, only slowing down because of the financial crisis. Following this was the coalition government. Tony Abbott. Strike. Malcolm Turnbull strike. Scott Morrison strike and housing still out of control. Now, with Anthony Albanese at the helm, we finish the decade with a massive increase in housing prices. If you bought a home in 1992 for half $1 million today, it would be worth $2.4 million. And if you were born after 1992, you probably don't own a home and might never. The conclusion is simple. This is beyond political parties. Australia's housing crisis runs deep. It is something that cannot be solved by jumping from one bandwagon to the next. What will it require? Incentivizing business investment. Lowering income taxes for hardworking Australians. Abolishing negative gearing. Lowering capital gains incentives. Removing red tape to encourage development and educated Australians who can keep politicians honest. You are the solution and your tool is policy. Good luck.

ZvSNcnG2eqY,2024-04-06T13:00:32Z,Why No One Wants to Live in Canada,"October 19th,
2015 election night in Canada, dissatisfied with
the direction of the country. Record numbers of Canadians
came out to vote. The result. Justin Trudeau is elected
Prime Minister of Canada, with a large crowd
cheering his name. Trudeau
had one simple message. It's time for a change
in this country, my friends. A real change. Canadians across the country
were excited and energized. They believed in a bright
future for Canada. The government would build
more homes, make life more affordable and usher
Canada into a golden age. The Canadian dream. But fast forward to today,
and that dream has faded. Housing prices have increased
at record rates. Food banks are turning away
hungry Canadians, and immigrants
are leaving in record numbers. The Canadian dream
has become a nightmare. This is the dark side
of Canada. If you talk to real Canadians,
more often than not, they will tell you
how hopeless they feel about their future. They'll share how,
when growing up, they dreamed of a life raising a family
in a comfortable home and in a safe neighborhood. Or with home prices soaring. This dream has become
a fantasy to buy the average home
in Canada. A family needs to earn
$170,000 per year. And in Vancouver that number
jumps dramatically to $360,000 per year. Compare this to the median
family income of $70,000. And it becomes clear that it is nearly impossible
to buy a home in Canada. Most Canadians who don't own
a home have given up and don't see it as remotely possible
in their lifetime. The sad part about this Canada's housing
wasn't always this expensive. In fact, homeownership was
possible for almost everyone. But in the last few decades, housing prices have increased
so much faster than wages that it has forced citizens to abandon
the hope of homeownership. Even if you can afford
a home, you aren't getting very much. Take Vancouver, for example. The average home here is nearly $2 million,
and it looks like this. Who wants to spend nearly $2 million
on a small home like this? When you can get a mansion
in places like Austin for the same amount? Now, not everyone
wants to buy a home, and many are perfectly fine renting. But renting is just as hard
as buying a home due to years of under building
NIMBYism, population growth and government
red tape. The supply of rental units
is far outweighed by demand Across Canada, rental vacancy sits at an all
time low of 1.5%. This means people are fighting
to find a place to live. Each application
for an apartment is met with hundreds
of competing applications, and renters are left
feeling hopeless. It's getting to the point where you can choose
to keep a roof over your head, or you can choose
to keep the lights on and eat. But you can't do both. The low levels of vacancy are leading to skyrocketing
prices. Landlords realize
that renters have few options, and therefore they continue
to raise rents to extract maximum value. Our landlord increased
our rent by 7000 per month. The outcome? Rents continue
to rise uncontrollably and will do so for years
to come. For example, the average one
bedroom apartment in Toronto and Vancouver
is nearly $3,000. After taxes and rent,
Canadians barely have enough money to make ends
meet. People are skipping meals,
taking up multiple jobs, living in their cars,
and more. Debt has become an absolute
necessity to make ends meet. And Canada now has the third highest household debt
to GDP ratio on Earth. All of this is compounded by the inability
of the government to help. In fact, many would argue
that the government is making life much harder
for Canadians. The problem with housing
affordability is a combination of federal
and local government policies and inaction
on a federal level. Prime Minister
Justin Trudeau has overseen the largest increase
in Canadian real estate prices in history. Much of this is due
to his immigration policy. Since 2016,
the government has admitted nearly 3 million immigrants
into the country. That is a record and 40%
higher per year in the last few decades. To make matters worse,
there are over 1 million foreign students
in the country. By increasing the population
so significantly in such a short
period of time. The government has squeezed an already under built
housing market. It is simple economics. Increasing demand
without increasing supply causes prices to go up. Furthermore,
most immigrants are looking for entry level
homes and apartments, placing a disproportionate
amount of pressure on average,
and young Canadians who are looking for
a starter property. For example,
many students at UBC can no longer find housing and now live in vans
and parking lots to survive. I have to wait, I guess like more than a year
to get housing on campus in UBC. One student even flies
from a different city because it's cheaper than rent. Rooming
houses are also commonplace across the country, where landlords squeeze five students into one bedroom
to maximize profit. Immigration
isn't the only reason for rising prices, though, and it's easy for folks
to point the finger. But Canada has underinvested
in housing for decades. In fact, CIBC estimates
that Canada needs 5 million more homes by 2030 to achieve
affordability targets. Developers agree
this is impossible. Of course, you can't flip the switch
overnight to build homes. And in Canada,
local governments have shown an unwillingness
to invest in housing. For one, citizens
who own homes are often against development as it would lower the value
of their properties. Permit
approvals are hard to get, and NIMBYism challenges
most large developments. Elected officials know this and therefore don't push hard
for housing to avoid losing an election. Furthermore, each city
and province levies a multitude of taxes that drive the cost
and timeline for development. In some cities, this can add over
20% to the cost of a home, and this cost is directly passed on to consumers
by developers. A part of the reason taxes
and red tape continue to increase is the government is growing
faster than the population. From 2020 to 2023. The B.C. government
grew by 23%. Compare this to the private
sector, which grew by only 1%. This explosive job
growth requires more taxes. A similar pattern can be seen
in the federal government, which has added nearly
$20 billion a year in costs since 2015, and the final nail in the coffin
for housing affordability. Foreign Investment Canada
is an extremely attractive and safe place
to invest your money, but it also happens to be
one of the easiest places in the OECD to launder money. Another bombshell
in the ongoing money laundering scandal in B.C., a report
commissioned by the government agreed and concluded that significant amounts
of black market money was buying and selling
properties in Canada, especially Vancouver
and Toronto. But what has the government
done to stop this? Nothing. Money laundering is
just as easy as ever. Now housing is just one
component of this nightmare. What about everyday costs
Canadians face? Canada saw food prices
rise by over 10% since 2022, leading nearly 2 million Canadians to visit
food banks in March of 2023, a record high and double
the 2019 levels. One of the reasons Canadian food prices are so high
is the lack of competition. But grocery chain
profits are not the reason for food inflation. A handful of companies
own nearly 80% market share. The government
has historically done nothing to prevent
food industry consolidation, which has led to
a highly concentrated market that is able to extract
maximum profits. The worst example of this is bread, which is dominated
by only two players. Not only this, but the government
has assisted in increasing
food prices in Canada by protecting the poultry,
egg and dairy industries. This alone cost
the average Canadian family nearly $450 per year. That could be the difference
between making rent or not. The federal plan puts a price on pollution
that brings down emissions, and it spurs innovation
on the kind of investments in emissions reduction
that we need. While at the same time
putting more money in the pockets of Canadians,
this story of government policies leading to higher
prices is nothing new. For example, the government introduced a carbon tax
which makes the cost of gas and heating more expensive
than ever. Canadians spend more on gas
than any other G7 country by a long shot. The carbon tax has been met with significant pushback
from citizens and politicians. In fact, Liberal MPs have spoken out
against the carbon tax as the number of complaints from constituents
has risen dramatically. This came to a head
in the Atlantic provinces when citizens
could no longer bear the cost of the carbon tax. Given the use of expensive
and very dirty fuel oil, the Liberal government
conceded and dropped the tax in an effort
to not lose support. Recently,
the government has pushed the narrative that most citizens
are better off in spite of carbon taxes
due to rebates. However, the parliamentary budget
officer clarified and said
that citizens are worse off if you include
the economic implications. But this isn't just limited to
carbon taxes. Canadians experience
higher prices across multiple industries
because of the government. The most glaring example
is telecommunications. Here's a quick question. Are we paying too much for
cell phone and internet
bills here in Canada? Absolutely. The Canadian wireless market
is the most expensive in the world, seven times more expensive
in Australia, and 1000 times more expensive than Finland. The craziest part
is that the fourth largest player, Shaw,
was recently acquired by the largest player
in the country. Rogers and the government
did nothing to stop it. In most countries, such a deal would most likely
be stopped or delayed. But in Canada, major corporations have extreme influence
and often get away with these
anti-competitive transactions. Banking is similar. There is no competition
nor options for consumers to start up. A bank is nearly impossible
in Canada due to tight regulatory controls that favor
large entities. This has led to Canadians
paying some of the highest banking fees
in the developed world. It is estimated that Canadians
pay $250 more per year on banking fees than peers
in the UK and Australia. Why? No competition. Now I could list a million
more examples, but the conclusion is
the same. Canada is extremely expensive. One way to counter
this is to grow the economy and introduce
high paying jobs. However, Canada has struggled
to do this. Since 2019, Canada
has seen a decline in economic productivity. While the US
has seen a 6% increase. This decline is partly responsible
for stagnant wages in Canada and reduction
in the quality of life. One of the drivers for this
decline is lack of private sector investment. Canadian businesses
are investing outside of Canada
more than ever before. But why aren't companies
investing in Canada? Simply put, they believe they can generate
greater returns elsewhere, especially as they lose faith in the current
Canadian regime, which is not seen as business
friendly. Another reason is lack
of competition. Most major Canadian industries are controlled
by a few key players. These players have no real
incentive to invest, leading to reductions
in productivity. The US has low levels
of market concentration
across industries, leading to constant
reinvestment and innovation. As companies continue
to seek a competitive edge, another reason is government
intervention. For example, Canada
has seen a major decline in investment
in the energy sector due to federal prices
that penalize the industry. Since 2014, energy investment
has declined by nearly $60
billion per year. But one could argue that oil
and gas is the past, and Canada should focus on
future proofing its economy. Which is absolutely fair. However, since 2016, GDP
derived from technology companies has only grown
with inflation, meaning
it hasn't really grown at all. All efforts by the government
to incentivize industrial investment
have failed. But this is not simply limited to large businesses
and money outflow. Canada is seeing an exodus
of startups and top talent like never before. Each year, 7% of Canadians
go south of the border searching for opportunity. And why wouldn't they? Jobs pay more. Cost of living is lower and
the US is much more dynamic. The loser in this scenario
is not the government, but hard working Canadians
whose lives continue to become more difficult as productivity
continues to decline. The central bank
will have less leeway to maintain lower interest
rates, further
challenging cost of living. Overall, the outlook does not
look great. Let's hope
that something changes soon. Subscribe to 2&20 for more business and economics insight."

streets chanting Take Back Control however today only 33% of British citizens think brexit was a good idea to date brexit is estimated to have cost the United Kingdom 160 billion pounds of economic activity and as Citizens catch up with the harsh realities of decoupling from the EU many brexit cheerleaders are changing their tune what once was seen as a Beacon of Hope has now turned into an economic nightmare so we asked the question was brexit worth it to answer this question we will explore the impact of brexit across one trade two foreign investment and three immigration at the end we will decide whether brexit was worth it when it comes to trade the EU offers members material trade benefits for one there are no duties or tariffs on goods and services moving between member nations but possibly more important there is no red tape that makes trade difficult the post brexit transition period ended on December 31st 20120 with the signing of the TCA Boris Johnson claimed that this would establish better trade deals with the EU and open Britain for increased trade with the rest of the world but was that true well not exactly you see since leaving the EU the UK's export volumes have materially lagged all advanced economies and trade intensity lags all other G7 countries but what exactly is causing this let's first look at red tape since brexit 80% of British registered businesses fa difficulties exporting to the EU it got so bad that the British Chamber of Commerce claimed that it was easier to trade with more distant countries than with Europe why is this when Britain was was under the EU borders meant nothing businesses could go and come as they pleased and since regulations were all consistent paperwork and red tape were nonexistent but now that there is a hard border between the EU and the UK red tape has exponentially increased large businesses are able to handle this by setting up branches in the EU but small businesses are faced with the impossibility of understanding and complying with extremely complicated rules and regulations in a iety of different languages similarly EU countries don't want to deal with a headache and are opting for non-british products to avoid any confusion and who can blame them to make matters worse the UK has chosen to reinvent the wheel when it comes to standards and regulations for instance instead of adopting the eu's classification system for chemicals Britain in its Infinite Wisdom decided to create their own system what's the benefit here none all this has done is created more confusion more red tape and required businesses to invest millions of dollars on reclassification but this isn't just limited to red tape historically there were no tariffs and duties now there are a ton but brexit supporters would argue that the UK has now established new agreements and trade with other countries around the world they have set up new agreements with Australia New Zealand India Israel and more and by not relying on the EU so much Britain has opened itself up to more opportunity well not exactly although trade with non-eu countries has increased it has not done enough to offset the declines in goods and service trade with the EU over the long term this might be corrected but only time will tell and frankly the UK does not have that much to offer the rest of the world and is a relatively small Market outside of financial services so what's the conclusion on economic activity brexit is a fail okay let's move on to foreign direct investment otherwise known as FDI FDI is important because it raises National productivity output and wages the UK was uniquely positioned among EU countries in that it had a strong banking system access to the euro Zone and most importantly it spoke English as such investment into UK businesses was Rising rapidly leading up to the brexit vote but right after the vote investment dropped dramatically businesses were spooked by the uncertainty of brexit and decided to invest elsewhere to understand the impact that brexit had on FDI we can look at the results of other advanced economies since 2016 the UK has underperformed all G7 economies on business investment growth by a long shot brexit cheerleaders will argue that UK is still number two in absolute terms only behind France however if the UK had not left the EU economists as made that FDI would be 12 billion pound more per year and that Britain would lead Europe in FDI and more importantly lead their arch nemesis France furthermore all industry segments in Britain have seen a decline in FDI whereas the EU has seen an increase across all segments unlike trade the negative impacts of FDI are slow to accumulate however economists estimate that lower FDI has already contributed to 29 billion pounds of lost GDP the reason for declining FDI is very very simple the UK has lost its Advantage it is no longer part of the largest trading block in the world and it doesn't have the most educated or trained Workforce it doesn't have much in the way of natural resources and all it really has is a financial center and the English language why you for I'm being Shish I'm being shady but that isn't enough anymore because there are tons of those around the world so what's the conclusion on FDI brexit was a bad idea lastly let's take a look at immigration frankly this might be the single biggest reason brexit supporters wanted to leave they were sick and tired of Britain looking less British the direct impact of brexit was to end free movement among EU countries leading up to brexit net immigration peaked at 330,000 people per anom this dropped by 25% following brexit so seemed like it was working but if you look at current immigration Trends it has jumped above historical immigration levels exceeding 700,000 net migrants although EU migration levels have dropped non-eu levels have increased substantially more this has been driven by a number of factors including international student flows healthcare workers and refugees this sharp increase has caused a rift in the conservative party with lawmakers saying things like the rise was completely unacceptable and will be unacceptable as well to the majority of British people Rishi sunak himself said that the number was too high so why the high immigration then well the UK has a labor shortage and an aging population both of these combined are placing a lot of pressure on businesses especially in health care and Hospitality to make matters worse the UK doesn't have the most productive economy and and its decline in trades and foreign investment have further placed pressure on industry overall the UK has little to no choice but to maintain high levels of immigration in line with or above pre-brexit levels to make matters worse India Nigeria and China make up the largest immigrant groups into the UK not very British looking if you ask me so the conclusion on immigration brexit has failed unless of course you love immigration in which case it's succeeded all right what's the conclusion here we started by asking was brexit worth it to kick things off we looked at trade on trade brexit has led to Britain legging all advanced economies and it has added more red tape tariffs and uncertainty fail on investment we saw that Britain has seen Decline and interest from foreign organizations being overtaken by their sworn enemies France again fail on immigration we ironically saw it rise to historic highs with no end in sight another fail and overall the UK has lost nearly 200 billion pounds of economic activity leading us to conclude that brexit was a terrible terrible idea regardless of what Boris Johnson's bus told you subscribe to 220 for more economics and business

h1IKxKWosco,2024-02-05T15:02:26Z,How Disney Lost It&#39;s Magic,Disney is dying in 2019 they did 3.7 billion at the box office but this year only 1.5 billion they released The Little Mermaid Indiana Jones Elemental and wish what do these movies have in common nobody watched them instead of giving people magical moments like this Disney keeps giving people more of this the results show while the S&P 500 has grown 70% Over The Last 5 Years Disney has declined 17% but this isn't as simple as it looks there are a number of reasons Disney is on the decline from subscriber losses box office blenders and asset sales Disney is in trouble let's take a look and find out how Disney lost its magic for this analysis we will discuss three key problems that Disney is facing one Poe content two streaming Wars and three the Slowdown of traditional media let's kick it off with poor content in the box office decline that Disney is facing the first decade of Disney was one filled with a lot of struggle and betrayal but it all changed when Walt Disney himself bed it all on Snow White after 3 years of Blood Sweat and Tears he released the movie and like a miracle it became the highest gross in film of all time fast forward to today Disney is set to release a liveaction version of Snow White but there's a catch the movie is not a love story the movie has no dwarves and Snow White is well not white listen to Rachel zler the new Snow White talk about the movie that it's no longer 1937 not going to be safe for The Prince and she's not going to be dreaming about true love this is where their box office problems Begin by not honoring the magic of Disney's IP the company continues to alienate its fan base this has been the case for Lightyear Mulan The Little Mermaid and much of the Star Wars and Marvel cannon not only has Disney disregarded the heritage of their IP but they have also squeezed every ounce out of their golden gooses for example since 20121 Marvel has released 11 films how are people supposed to care about the movies and characters if there are so many people only have so much time a Disney movie used to be an event but by releasing so many films the company has diluted the brand value of much of their IP and has given fewers superhero Star Wars and general movie fatigue they need Thanos to snap his fingers and get rid of half of their content the other problem with this strategy is how much it costs to make these big budget films to make the economics work Disney needs to sell a boat load of box office tickets however over the last 3 years Disney has lost at least $1 billion on its movies the return on invested capital is just not there now it's not all Disney's fault people are spending less time at the movies than ever before with the Advent of streaming platforms and behavioral changes caused by Co people are less inclined to go to the theaters and it shows in the numbers worldwide box office sales have not been this low since 2001 overall this does not look good but wait Disney has a plan streaming in 2019 Disney unveiled their streaming platform Disney plus early on it looked like a genius move and Wall Street loved the story but something happened after reaching a peak of 164 million subscribers in 2022 Disney lost a record 12 million subscribers from Q2 to Q3 of 2023 but why are subscribers leaving for one there are multiple competitors when it comes to Price Disney Disney is one of the most expensive when it comes to the number of TV shows Disney is not competitive when it comes to the number of movies Disney is not competitive and when it comes to adult oriented content Disney is definitely not competitive in an extremely competitive environment how do you make a profit well you don't since its Inception Disney plus has lost over 11 billion dollar to put things into perspective Netflix over the same period made $25 billion in profits but how hard is it to turn a profit very hard for one as the economy slows down consumers are decreasing their spending and rationalizing streaming services furthermore Disney is not just competing against incumbents like Netflix they're also competing against Tech juggernauts Amazon and apple who each have six times more cash than Disney to Apple and Amazon streaming is a drop in the bucket streaming represents 20 2 2% of Disney's Revenue compared to 2 and 0.5% for Amazon and apple respectively their businesses are much less reliant on streaming services then there's the problem of customer acquisition Amazon has one of the most visited sites in the world they can easily funnel new customers through both amazon.com and their Prime delivery service Apple can Market through Apple TV to every single iPhone in the world and there are a lot of iPhones but what does Disney have traditional ad markets this is why it's extremely important that Disney plus starts clawing its way to profitability sooner than later you see currently Disney is focused on cost cutting to reach profitability but this is a double-edged sword cutting cost will make it harder to Market and create awesome content that will attract new subscribers an IP is what attracts or loses subscribers and cutting back on an already thin Content Library is going to put an immense amount of pressure on Disney okay so the Disney plus story doesn't look great however while Disney plus isn't close to bringing in a profit for Disney and won't be anytime soon linear TV which includes ABC and ESPN is but there's a catch traditional media is Disney's Cash Cow ESPN alone represents about 20% of Disney's total profit the business model is great sticky viewers stable revenues healthy profit margins it is everything a capitalist could dream of but as cord cutting progresses and sports rights fees increase linear TV is struggling profits from ESPN Branded TV networks ESPN programming and ESPN plus fell nearly 8% over the last 9 months ESPN is in a period of transition its pay TV linear channel Lost nearly 1 million customers in the first quarter of 2023 Talent is even suffering in July ESPN let go over 20 ESPN personalities including Max Kellerman and Jeff Van Gundy Disney knows the clock is running out for their traditional media segment and frankly there's almost nothing they can do viewers are consuming less of TV content as they opt in to streaming services and shorter form content like YouTube and Tik Tok things have gotten so bad that Disney is frantically exploring a minority sale of ESPN they've explored packs with the NFL and NBA in which the leagues would Supply programming in exchange for small Equity stakes in ESPN all of this screams one thing Disney does not see a future for these assets and wants to monetize whatever they can now okay so what does this all mean Disney is failing to resonate with audiences at the box office and is losing money left right and Center their big bet on Disney plus isn't going as well as they would have liked and they are bleeding money and their Legacy Media business is in structural decline threatening the cash cow that has enabled them to take big bets like Disney Plus the only bright spot which we didn't discuss is their theme parks but even those are facing challenges in Disney's Home Market of the USA overall the future for Disney does not look so bright and in the immortal words of Porky the Pig That's all folks
